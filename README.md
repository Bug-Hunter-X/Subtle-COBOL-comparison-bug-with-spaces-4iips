This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in COBOL programs involving the comparison of alphanumeric fields containing spaces.  The `bug.cob` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides a corrected version. The issue arises from the inconsistent handling of leading and trailing spaces during comparisons.  The solution highlights a robust approach to ensure accurate comparisons, regardless of the presence of extra spaces.
